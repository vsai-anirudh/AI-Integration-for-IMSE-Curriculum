# Using Industry Case Studies with NotebookLM

This repository includes industry-inspired case studies designed to help IMSE students
connect course concepts with real-world manufacturing and systems engineering problems.
These case studies are intended to be used with Google NotebookLM as a guided learning tool.

## Role of NotebookLM
NotebookLM is used as a case-study tutor, not a solution generator.
All responses are grounded in the uploaded course materials and case study PDFs.

NotebookLM helps students:
- Generate structured overviews of case studies
- Map real problems to IMSE frameworks (e.g., DMAIC)
- Understand why specific tools and methods are appropriate
- Organize reports and presentations

Final analysis, interpretation, and conclusions remain the responsibility of the student.

## Example NotebookLM Uses
Students may use NotebookLM to:
- Summarize the case context using course terminology
- Identify relevant performance metrics
- Understand analytical structure
- Prepare reports and presentations

## Example NotebookLM Prompts
The following prompts are safe, academic, and instructor-appropriate:

- “Summarize the manufacturing productivity problem described in the case study using Lean Six Sigma terminology.”
- “Map the case study activities to each phase of the DMAIC framework.”
- “Which productivity metrics are most relevant in this case and why?”
- “Explain the root causes identified in the Analyze phase using concepts from the uploaded lecture notes.”
- “Help me outline a project report based on this case study.”

These prompts are intended to guide thinking and structure analysis, not replace it.
