# Resume Assistant Overview

The resume assistant is an AI-driven tool that helps IMSE students tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

It supports three main functions:

1. **Job Description Analysis**  
   - Extracts essential qualifications, technical skills (e.g., predictive maintenance, CMMS, Lean Six Sigma, reliability tools), data skills (Excel, Power BI, statistical software), and soft skills (collaboration, leadership, communication).

2. **Resume Comparison and Gap Identification**  
   - Compares the job description with the student's resume.  
   - Highlights missing keywords, under-represented projects or achievements, and soft skills that are requested but not visible.

3. **Tailored Recommendations**  
   - Suggests concrete wording changes, skills to emphasize, and achievements to reframe with quantifiable impact.  
   - Recommends sections to add or strengthen for ATS compatibility and readability.

By guiding students through this workflow, the assistant improves ATS compliance, employer relevance, clarity of skills, and overall confidence in presenting their experience in a competitive job market.
