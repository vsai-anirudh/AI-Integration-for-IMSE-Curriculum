# Setup Google NotebookLM

1. Sign into NotebookLM: https://notebooklm.google.com/ using your Google account.
2. Click **Create New Notebook** and name it `IMSE – Lean Six Sigma` (or similar).
3. Upload files:
   - Go to **Add content** → Upload files → add PDFs (lecture slides, Lean Six Sigma notes), case study PDFs, and the project reports.

5. Connect Google Workspace (optional):

   - Material Map / Mind Map  
   - Summaries & FAQs  
   - Audio Overview (playable in the Studio panel)  
   - Quizzes and flashcards (Studio → Quiz)
7. Use the studio features:
   - Generate Audio Overview for lecture chapters.  
   - Export the Mind Map as an image (screenshot saved to `screenshots/`).
8. Reproduce the case study steps:
   - Ask NotebookLM: “Generate a DMAIC outline for [upload name]” and save the responses.
9. Save important NotebookLM outputs by exporting text or copying into `notebooks/` or into markdown files in this repo.

**Note**
- All NotebookLM answers are source-cited in the UI. Save relevant citations as proof if required.
- If using an institutional Google Workspace, consider the Pro/Enterprise features for sharing and analytics.
