# Supply Chain Forecasting Application Template

This template supports structured analysis of demand forecasting and
supply chain planning problems using AI-assisted reasoning.

The focus is on model selection, assumptions, and interpretation,
not automated forecasting outputs.

---

## How to Use This Template
1. Review forecasting and supply chain analytics course materials.
2. Understand the demand environment and business context.
3. Use the prompts below in NotebookLM to guide analysis and reasoning.
4. Validate results and assumptions independently.

---

## Project Context (Student Input)
Provide:
- Product or service description
- Historical demand data availability
- Forecast horizon (short, medium, long term)
- Business objective (inventory control, service level, cost reduction)

---

## Problem Definition
Prompt:
“I am working on a supply chain forecasting problem.
Here is the context: [describe product, market, and demand behavior].
Help me clearly define the forecasting objective and constraints.”

---

## Data Understanding
Prompt:
“Based on the available demand data: [describe data],
what patterns (trend, seasonality, variability) should I examine
before selecting a forecasting approach?”

---

## Model Selection
Prompt:
“Given the demand characteristics, what forecasting methods
(e.g., moving average, exponential smoothing, regression)
are appropriate, and why?”

---

## Forecast Evaluation
Prompt:
“How should forecast accuracy be evaluated for this problem?
Which error metrics are most relevant and why?”

---

## Managerial Interpretation
Prompt:
“How should forecast results be interpreted for decision-making
related to inventory, capacity, or service levels?”
