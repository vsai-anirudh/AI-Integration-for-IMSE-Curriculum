# Production Planning and Scheduling Application Template

This template helps students structure production planning and scheduling
problems commonly encountered in manufacturing systems.

AI is used to organize thinking around constraints, objectives, and trade-offs.

---

## How to Use This Template
1. Review production planning and manufacturing systems materials.
2. Understand system constraints and operational objectives.
3. Use the prompts below in NotebookLM to structure analysis.
4. Confirm feasibility and practicality independently.

---

## System Context (Student Input)
Provide:
- Description of the production system
- Products and demand requirements
- Resources (machines, labor, shifts)
- Constraints (capacity, sequencing, lead times)

---

## Problem Definition
Prompt:
“I am working on a production planning or scheduling problem.
Here is the system context: [describe system].
Help me define objectives, constraints, and decision variables.”

---

## Data and Constraints
Prompt:
“Given the system description and data: [describe data],
what constraints and assumptions should be explicitly modeled?”

---

## Planning Approach
Prompt:
“What production planning or scheduling approaches
(e.g., aggregate planning, lot sizing, sequencing rules)
are appropriate for this system, and why?”

---

## Trade-off Analysis
Prompt:
“What trade-offs should be considered between cost, throughput,
inventory, and service level in this planning problem?”

---

## Implementation Considerations
Prompt:
“What operational risks or implementation challenges
should be considered when applying this plan in practice?”
