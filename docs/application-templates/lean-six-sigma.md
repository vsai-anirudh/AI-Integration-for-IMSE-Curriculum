# Lean Six Sigma Application Template (DMAIC)

This template guides students through a structured Lean Six Sigma analysis
using the DMAIC framework. It supports reasoning and organization while
preserving academic integrity.

The AI acts as a workflow guide, not a solution generator.

---

## How to Use This Template
1. Review relevant Lean Six Sigma course materials and case studies.
2. Understand the process and problem context independently.
3. Use the prompts below in NotebookLM to structure your analysis.
4. Validate insights and draw conclusions on your own.

---

## Define
Prompt:
“I am working on a Lean Six Sigma project. Here is the process context:
[describe process]. Help me define the problem statement, objectives,
stakeholders, and success metrics.”

---

## Measure
Prompt:
“Given this process and the available data: [describe data],
what performance metrics should be measured and how can a baseline be established?”

---

## Analyze
Prompt:
“Analyze this process using Lean Six Sigma tools.
Identify potential root causes and explain how they relate to observed metrics.”

---

## Improve
Prompt:
“Based on the analysis, suggest improvement ideas aligned with Lean principles.
