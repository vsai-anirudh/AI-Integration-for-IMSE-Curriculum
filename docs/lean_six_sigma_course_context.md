These Lean Six Sigma course materials provide the core content used to demonstrate AI integration in the IMSE context, including a real-world case study of reducing defect rates in an automotive component assembly line, DMAIC class slides, and textbook excerpts. NotebookLM combines these sources to generate overviews of the project context and supports queries such as explaining root causes of defects or generating tailored DMAIC outlines for the case study.  

Lean Six Sigma was selected as the pilot area for AI integration because its structured, data‑driven DMAIC methodology aligns well with AI capabilities such as automating repetitive analyses, forecasting process behavior from historical data, monitoring performance in real time, and detecting complex patterns that traditional methods might miss. Using these course materials with NotebookLM allows students to practice statistical reasoning, process optimization, and quality improvement with AI‑enhanced templates and guided workflows, deepening their analytical skills and readiness for industry applications.
