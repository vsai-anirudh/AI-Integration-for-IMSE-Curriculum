# Resume Assistant – ATS Prompt

You can use the following prompt with an AI chatbot to act as a resume assistant for IMSE students:

> I want you to act as an experienced ATS expert and resume consultant.  
> I will provide you with a job description and my resume. Please:  
> 1. Analyze both documents and identify key technical skills, qualifications, and experience requirements from the job description.  
> 2. Compare these against my resume and identify:  
>    - Keywords and skills that are missing  
>    - Experience or achievements not reflected  
>    - Soft skills emphasized in the job description  
> 3. Suggest specific changes:  
>    - Words or phrases to add  
>    - Skills to emphasize  
>    - Achievements to reframe with quantified results  
>    - Any missing sections (e.g., Technical Skills, Projects)

Then paste:

- Job description under: **“Here is the job description”**  
- Your resume under: **“Here is my current resume”**.
