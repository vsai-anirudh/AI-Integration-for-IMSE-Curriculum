# Resume Template Guide for IMSE Students

This guide explains how to use the AI-based resume assistant to tailor resumes to specific roles (e.g., Reliability Engineer, Manufacturing Engineer).

## What the assistant does

- Analyzes job descriptions to extract:
  - Essential qualifications (degree, years of experience, certifications)
  - Technical skills (predictive maintenance, CMMS, Lean Six Sigma, SPC, RCM, Minitab, Power BI)
  - Data skills and tools
  - Soft skills (cross-functional collaboration, leadership, communication)
- Compares these requirements with the student's resume.
- Flags:
  - Missing or weak keywords
  - Projects or achievements that can be reframed as industry outcomes
  - Soft skills emphasized in the posting but not visible in the resume
- Suggests:
  - Phrases or skills to add for ATS alignment
  - Achievements to rewrite with metrics
  - Sections to add or strengthen (e.g., Technical Skills, Projects)
  - Formatting improvements for ATS readability.
